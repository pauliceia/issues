Copy the generated URL and clone the repository locally with the command "git clone <SSH>" in your terminal, as in the example below:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:stackOvercrow/pauliceia.git
```
  
When cloning, the remote repository on Github will automatically be configured as remote on your environment. Now you can develop your feature.

### 3- Pushing to the remote repository

As soon as you finish developing your feature, open the terminal in the folder of your local repository. Use the commands below to add your files, create a commit and send it to the remote repository:
  
``` bash
git add .
git commit -m "Nome do Commit aqui"
git push origin master
```
